## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

    This app visualizes a song through art that is in the Metropolitan Museum's Collection
    of art. It pulls keywords on the song and artist that a user inputs, using the Last.fm api.
    Then it queries those keywords into the Met API to retrieve art. For each API, I
    needed to make 2 requests. I also needed to filter for duplicate keywords and art.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?
    I feel like I better understand API's and Json's more. I feel like it'll be
    a lot easier to use them in future projects. Also I became pretty savvy with making HTTP requests
    as well as parsing that information and filtering out invalid data.


## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

    I like the way I executed this project for the most part. I could've
    utilized threads more or definetly made custom components to make my code simpler
    and easier to understand.
